# Agentic software engineering (ASE) template repository

This is a simple template repository for bootstrapping agentic software engineering (ASE) projects.

## Layout

Context is centralized in this `AGENTS.md` file, then symlinked to:

- `CLAUDE.md`: for Claude Code
- `GEMINI.md`: for Gemini CLI
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: for GitHub Copilot

Additionally, a `bin/cursor_rules.sh` script copies the context to a common Cursor rule file.

See the `README.md` for more details.
