# README markdown table

Add a markdown table in the README. Include 3 columns:

- what
- how
- why

This should go through the various agent files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) and the directories (tasks, prompts, src) and clearly describe what they are and how they are used. Be succinct. Ask me if you're confused
